I grew up in a small rural town in mid-Missouri named Marshall & came to St. Louis in 1985 to attend college at Washington University in St. Louis. I double-majored in English & Education & minored in History. After that I stayed & earned a Masters in English & then worked on a Ph.D. in 17c Brit Lit for another 6 years before switching my career over to focus on this little thing called the “World Wide Something-or-Other” that I first discovered in 1995. It seems to have worked out well — both that Web thing & my new career as a technologist. 😃
